      May 23, 2025 at 6:05AM Key Points One of AI's most crucial companies trades at a considerable discount. This travel technology company can drive investor returns through AI-driven decision-making. It is much too early to dismiss this AI-driven tech conglomerate. Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now â€º NYSE: TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Market Cap $1.0T Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-2.59%)Â -$5.08 CurrentÂ Price $191.11 Price as of May 23, 2025, 10:19 a.m. ET A $3,000 investing budget may not sound like a lot, especially when reading about the massive portfolios of many pros. Nonetheless, some investors have built considerable portfolios on less, making such a sum a good place to start."
"ET A $3,000 investing budget may not sound like a lot, especially when reading about the massive portfolios of many pros. Nonetheless, some investors have built considerable portfolios on less, making such a sum a good place to start. Moreover, with demand for technologies driven by artificial intelligence (AI) going through the roof, investors can still find AI-related stocks with significant potential for gains. When taking these factors into account, investors may want to consider investments in the three following stocks. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Taiwan Semiconductor Investors will likely struggle to find a company more central to AI than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM -2.59% ) , the leading manufacturer for all of the top chip companies. Although its customers design their chips, Nvidia , Apple , Qualcomm , and many others depend on TSMC (as the company is also known) to manufacture their most advanced chips."
"Although its customers design their chips, Nvidia , Apple , Qualcomm , and many others depend on TSMC (as the company is also known) to manufacture their most advanced chips. According to market researcher TrendForce, TSMC dominates its industry with a 67% market share. And it shows no signs of stopping, even as it yields to political pressure to produce more chips outside of Taiwan. The company has pledged between $38 billion and $42 billion on capital expenditures this year and will increase its total investment in its U.S. factories to $165 billion. TSMC's growth is so strong that it generated $26 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, a 42% increase from a year ago. That generated $12 billion in net income, 47% higher year over year, as it kept a lid on operating expenses. But TSMC sells at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25 despite the rapidly improving financials. That likely means a low valuation and rapid profit growth should help push the stock higher. 2."
"But TSMC sells at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25 despite the rapidly improving financials. That likely means a low valuation and rapid profit growth should help push the stock higher. 2. Airbnb Investors tend to think of Airbnb ( ABNB -0.53% ) as a travel stock and give little thought to its AI. Nonetheless, Airbnb thrives on a strong brand identity, network effects, and a website that links interested parties who need travel accommodations with homeowners. It uses AI to perform many of the required tasks more effectively. Among these AI-driven capabilities is writing a property description based on pictures, providing customer service, optimizing pricing, and detecting fraud. These abilities allow the site to more effectively draw customers while reducing operational costs. In the last quarter, they helped Airbnb book 143 million nights and experiences, an 8% yearly increase. A sluggish economy and more-intense competition have weighed on Airbnb."
"In the last quarter, they helped Airbnb book 143 million nights and experiences, an 8% yearly increase. A sluggish economy and more-intense competition have weighed on Airbnb. Its first-quarter revenue of $2.3 billion was just an 8% increase. Also, higher spending in product development as well as sales and marketing reduced its profits. Consequently, the company earned $154 million in the first quarter, down from $264 million a year ago. Still, a sluggish stock performance has kept its valuation in check, and it trades at just 35 times earnings. That is significantly below late last year, when the P/E was just under 50. With this AI stock looking increasingly like a bargain, it could spark a recovery as Airbnb's value proposition continues to improve. 3. Alphabet Another affordable AI stock that investors seem to have overlooked in recent years is Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL -0.96% ) ( GOOG -0.79% ) . The company is an AI pioneer, having introduced the technology as early as 2001."
"Alphabet Another affordable AI stock that investors seem to have overlooked in recent years is Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL -0.96% ) ( GOOG -0.79% ) . The company is an AI pioneer, having introduced the technology as early as 2001. But the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI models has called Alphabet's business model into question -- the advertising that supports Google Search and other platforms was 74% of revenue in the first quarter of 2025. The company owns numerous businesses, and Google Cloud has generated an increasing share of its revenue. Moreover, a recent funding round valued its autonomous-vehicle segment Waymo at $45 billion, even though it's never mentioned in earnings reports. The recent report said that first-quarter revenue of $90 billion rose 12% compared to the same quarter in 2024. Also, reduced expense growth helped boost the company's net income, which surged 46% higher to almost $35 billion. Despite that increase, the stock fell slightly over the last year."
"Also, reduced expense growth helped boost the company's net income, which surged 46% higher to almost $35 billion. Despite that increase, the stock fell slightly over the last year. That allowed its P/E to fall to just 19, making it the "" Magnificent Seven "" stock with the lowest valuation. That lower earnings multiple and rapid profit growth have given investors the opportunity to buy a prominent AI stock at a discount.

      May 23, 2025 at 7:45AM Key Points Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb took a big stake in Alphabet in the first quarter. He feels the market is missing the big AI advantages that this company has. The stock is trading at an attractive valuation -- presenting an opportunity for investors. Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now â€º NASDAQ: GOOGL Alphabet Market Cap $2.1T Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.96%)Â -$1.64 CurrentÂ Price $169.23 Price as of May 23, 2025, 10:18 a.m. ET Billionaire Daniel Loeb of Third Point Management is known as a value investor, and last quarter he was picking up shares of beaten-down tech giant Alphabet ( GOOGL -0.96% ) ( GOOG -0.79% ) ."
"ET Billionaire Daniel Loeb of Third Point Management is known as a value investor, and last quarter he was picking up shares of beaten-down tech giant Alphabet ( GOOGL -0.96% ) ( GOOG -0.79% ) . Alphabet's stock is down about 13% year to date as of this writing, as investors worry about the future impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on its search business. However, Loeb has a different view and bought $453 million worth of Alphabet stock in the quarter. Here's why. Why Loeb was buying Alphabet Loeb wrote exactly why he was buying Alphabet stock in Third Point's first-quarter letter to investors. These investment letters are common in the hedge fund industry and give investors a quarterly update on a fund's investment performance. Portfolio managers will also often highlight a few investment ideas or talk about the current investing or macro environment in these letters."
"Portfolio managers will also often highlight a few investment ideas or talk about the current investing or macro environment in these letters. In his letter, Loeb told investors that he made a significant investment in Alphabet in the quarter, while acknowledging the market's worry about AI search and chatbots on Google search. He said that this concern is not entirely unfounded, but that Alphabet has advantages that are being overlooked. The first big advantage Loeb noted that Alphabet has is distribution. While he did not go into the particulars, this can be seen in several areas. First and foremost, the company is currently the default search engine on billions of devices. It provides the operating system for Android devices, which use its search engine. Android is estimated to power around 70% of the world's smartphones. Alphabet also owns the world's most widely used search browser, Chrome, where it is also the default search engine."
"Android is estimated to power around 70% of the world's smartphones. Alphabet also owns the world's most widely used search browser, Chrome, where it is also the default search engine. In addition, it currently has a revenue-sharing search deal to be the exclusive search engine on Apple devices. This gives it access to another nearly 30% of the market not powered by Android. It also has revenue-sharing deals with other browsers, such as Opera . In addition, Alphabet owns one of the world's largest advertising networks. It really can't be underestimated how much time and effort the company has put into developing its local ad presence. While AI companies are still trying to figure out the best way to monetize their offerings, Alphabet can connect advertisers with consumers on everything from a global to a local level. This is a huge monetization advantage over competitors. The second big advantage Loeb said Alphabet has is technology."
"This is a huge monetization advantage over competitors. The second big advantage Loeb said Alphabet has is technology. He noted that some initial Gemini AI model blunders caused investors to forget that Alphabet has been building out its AI capabilities for over a decade. He highlighted that a paper by Google engineers paved the way for the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) , while the company has two leading AI research organizations in Google Brain and DeepMind. He believes that Alphabet is close to beginning to monetize Gemini in a meaningful way. As for the impact on Google search, Loeb envisions a world where generative AI takes content creation costs to near zero, leading to more internet content, whether it be articles, entire websites, or video. However, with this increased content, it will become more difficult and expensive for businesses to stand out and attract customers."
"However, with this increased content, it will become more difficult and expensive for businesses to stand out and attract customers. In a world flooded with low-quality and fake AI-generated content, he thinks Google Search will become even more valuable as a source of truth. Loeb said he is also encouraged by Alphabet's recent cost discipline and how it is taking a tougher stance on employee protests. Back in 2018, Alphabet had canceled a large military AI project, Project Maven, due to employee protests -- and Palantir Technologies would take over the project as a result. Image source: Getty Images. Is Alphabet stock a buy? While there is a Google search disruption risk, Loeb lays out a nice argument as to why he does not think this will happen and why Alphabet will be an AI winner. I also think it's important to note that traditionally the company only serves ads on 20% of its search queries. Even if AI shrinks overall search queries, it could ultimately make them more valuable to advertisers."
"I also think it's important to note that traditionally the company only serves ads on 20% of its search queries. Even if AI shrinks overall search queries, it could ultimately make them more valuable to advertisers. At the same time, with its large ad network, Alphabet should also be able to find new ways to monetize things like AI Overviews, expanding its overall search revenue opportunities. And of course, Alphabet is also about much more than search. It also owns the most-watched streaming platform in the world and the third-largest cloud computing business. Cloud computing, in particular, has been a big growth driver for the company, and it is investing heavily to keep up with the growing demand for its services. Its Waymo robotaxi business is also growing rapidly and has the potential to be its next big business. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 17 times 2025 analyst estimates, the stock is in the bargain bin, making it an attractive option to buy at current levels."

      May 23, 2025 at 4:55AM Key Points Nvidia has a dominant market share in the GPU space. Alphabet's AI search advantages are largely being ignored by investors. Both stocks have attractive valuations. Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now â€º NASDAQ: NVDA Nvidia Market Cap $3.2T Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-1.48%)Â -$1.97 CurrentÂ Price $130.86 Price as of May 23, 2025, 10:18 a.m. ET With the stock market having calmed down and settled into a more normal trading pattern, now might be a good time to start investing in some great tech stocks. $1,000 is a great starting point to begin accumulating shares, and then if the market dips again, you have room to add more. Let's look at two terrific tech stocks to start buying now with a $1,000 investment."
"Let's look at two terrific tech stocks to start buying now with a $1,000 investment. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia continues to benefit from the growth of AI Chip giant Nvidia ( NVDA -1.48% ) remains the best-positioned company to continue to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, providing the computing power needed to run AI workloads. The company's dominance in the GPU space can be seen in its over 80% market share. While the company's chips are top-notch, what has really set it apart and created a wide moat is its CUDA software platform. It created the free software platform to allow developers to be able to program its chips for purposes beyond their original intent of helping speed up graphics rendering in video games. Since then, it has built a collection of libraries and tools on top of its platform called CUDA X that helps bolster the performance of its chips for AI tasks."
"Since then, it has built a collection of libraries and tools on top of its platform called CUDA X that helps bolster the performance of its chips for AI tasks. The company sees demand for its GPUs coming from multiple areas. The biggest is in the cloud computing space, where the big three providers are aggressively building out data centers to keep up with the demand stemming from customers looking to customize AI models and run AI workloads on their systems. In addition, companies that build foundation AI models, such as Meta Platforms and xAI, have also been building out data centers, while OpenAI is part of the Stargate Project, a consortium that plans to spend $500 billion on data centers over the next few years. Enterprises have also started to increase their on-premise data center spending as they look to deploy hybrid cloud models for AI. At the same time, countries have also begun to invest in AI infrastructure. For example, on his trip to the Middle East, U.S."
"At the same time, countries have also begun to invest in AI infrastructure. For example, on his trip to the Middle East, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a big AI infrastructure investment from Saudi Arabia. When looking at risks, the biggest one Nvidia faces is if AI infrastructure spending begins to slow. The company does not have a recurring revenue stream like a software company, so it relies on increased demand for its chips. Right now, though, it appears that AI infrastructure spending is poised to continue to ramp up. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of under 31 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.6 price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) , with numbers below 1 considered undervalued. Alphabet looks to benefit from its agentic AI efforts One tech stock that has been tossed in the bargain bin this year is Alphabet ( GOOGL -0.96% ) ( GOOG -0.79% ) ."
"Alphabet looks to benefit from its agentic AI efforts One tech stock that has been tossed in the bargain bin this year is Alphabet ( GOOGL -0.96% ) ( GOOG -0.79% ) . While the company has continued to post strong revenue and earnings growth, investors remain concerned that AI is going to disrupt its main search business. Alphabet's Google search engine has a dominant position in search, with an approximate 90% global market share. However, there is no doubt that AI chatbots are gaining momentum and beginning to become more mainstream. While they have their flaws, there are many things that these AI chatbots do well, and they can answer more complex questions better than a search. But Google Search doesn't make much money from searches involving things like helping students with a biology paper or helping someone design a workout routine. Historically, it has only served ads on about 20% of its queries and makes money from searches with a commercial intent."
"Historically, it has only served ads on about 20% of its queries and makes money from searches with a commercial intent. As such, when the company recently introduced its new AI Mode for search, it came with clear ways to improve upon inquiries with commercial intent. This included agentic capabilities, where it can search across platforms to present you with the best ticket prices from sites like Ticketmaster and StubHub for a concert or sporting event. Need to research a summer camp for your child with specific criteria and distance from your home? It can do that. It also has a Shop by AI Mode that can find items based on your description, let you try on outfits virtually using an uploaded photo of yourself, and even track prices for items you are interested in. In addition to its often-overlooked strength in AI, Alphabet has some big advantages that tend to get ignored."
"In addition to its often-overlooked strength in AI, Alphabet has some big advantages that tend to get ignored. Between its Android smartphone operating system, Chrome browser, and revenue-sharing deal with Apple to be the exclusive search engine for Safari, the company is the default search engine on most devices connected to the internet. It also has the world's largest advertising network, and its reach in local markets around the globe is difficult to replicate. As such, in what is ultimately a two-sided marketplace of consumers and advertisers, Google has been able to entrench itself on both sides. So, despite the inroads that Perplexity and ChatGPT have made, Google still has a solid moat. With a forward P/E of only 17.5 times, Alphabet stock is cheap. Investors also get a lot more than Alphabet's search business. They get its fast-growing cloud computing business, a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in Waymo , and the most watched video streaming service in the world with YouTube."

      May 23, 2025 at 4:00AM Key Points Quantum computing research requires a ton of resources. There are large and small competitors in this realm. Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now â€º NASDAQ: GOOGL Alphabet Market Cap $2.1T Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.96%)Â -$1.64 CurrentÂ Price $169.23 Price as of May 23, 2025, 10:18 a.m. ET Quantum computing is an incredibly promising technology. It could unlock new ways to solve some of the world's most complex problems. Multiple companies are investing heavily in this arms race, and businesses of all sizes are vying for quantum computing supremacy. While some of the start-ups are intriguing, I prefer to focus on more established companies investing some of their vast resources into quantum computing."
"While some of the start-ups are intriguing, I prefer to focus on more established companies investing some of their vast resources into quantum computing. Two that top the list for me are Alphabet ( GOOG -0.79% ) ( GOOGL -0.96% ) and Microsoft ( MSFT -0.74% ) . Both companies have resources that other companies could only dream of, which is why I think they will end up at the top of the quantum computing arms race. Image source: Getty Images. Quantum computing has a difficult problem to solve Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment trend in December with the announcement of its Willow quantum computing chip. It announced a breakthrough that allowed it to arrange qubits on the chip so that there were fewer errors in the calculation. This is the primary problem quantum computing companies are facing, as quantum computing has inherent errors. Traditional computing transmits information in bits, either a 0 or a 1."
"This is the primary problem quantum computing companies are facing, as quantum computing has inherent errors. Traditional computing transmits information in bits, either a 0 or a 1. There's no room for interpreting that signal incorrectly, so traditional computing isn't prone to the errors that quantum computing is. Quantum computing utilizes qubits, which transmit information as the probability of an answer being a 0 or a 1. This has its perks and drawbacks. Qubits can transmit far more information about a calculation per unit. On the downside, there is room for errors to develop because the answer isn't explicitly a 0 or a 1. Competitors have made multiple attempts to solve this problem, and each company has devised its own solution. Google's solution was to arrange the qubits in a grid-like pattern to reduce the number of errors each qubit has."
"Competitors have made multiple attempts to solve this problem, and each company has devised its own solution. Google's solution was to arrange the qubits in a grid-like pattern to reduce the number of errors each qubit has. Microsoft claimed to have created a new state of matter that allowed the particle to be controlled more precisely in its chip, which gave it far more accurate information. Time will tell which path is optimal, or if both are acceptable solutions to the same problem. But one thing is certain: Both companies have the resources to compete. Both companies have financial resources the upstarts could only dream about One of the more popular pure-play investments in the quantum computing arms race is IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) . IonQ relies on external contracts to fund the company, which it realizes as revenue. In the first quarter, IonQ's revenue totaled just over $7.5 million."
"IonQ relies on external contracts to fund the company, which it realizes as revenue. In the first quarter, IonQ's revenue totaled just over $7.5 million. For both Microsoft and Alphabet, $7.5 million is a rounding error, and they can afford to throw far greater resources at quantum computing. Free cash flow measures how much cash a company generates after operating expenses are subtracted. Over the past three years, both companies have hovered around the $20 billion per quarter mark, so investing $500 million or so each quarter in the quantum computing business wouldn't be that big of a deal for either company. MSFT Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YCharts This is a key factor in the AI arms race: The big tech giants can outspend the start-ups. While David and Goliath stories exist for a reason, with how much research and intense computing power are needed to get quantum computing to a usable point, I want to invest in the bigger players for quantum computing exposure."
"While David and Goliath stories exist for a reason, with how much research and intense computing power are needed to get quantum computing to a usable point, I want to invest in the bigger players for quantum computing exposure. As another benefit, they still have a strong base business to lean on if either of these two loses the quantum computing arms race. If one of the start-ups loses, it's done.

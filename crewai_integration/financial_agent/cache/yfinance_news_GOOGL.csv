"Since its launch in 2023 , the AI-based note-taking and research assistant has only been accessible via desktop. Google has now made the service available on the go. NotebookLM is designed to help people better understand complex information through features like smart summaries and the ability to ask questions about documents and other materials. Image Credits: Google The app gives access to Audio Overviews , which are NotebookLM’s AI-generated podcasts based on the source materials you have provided. There is background playback and offline support for Audio Overviews. The app also allows people to create new notebooks and view the ones they’ve already created. Plus, when you’re viewing a website, PDF, or YouTube video on your device, you can tap the share icon and select NotebookLM to add it as a new source. Users can also view sources that they have already uploaded in each of the notebooks."

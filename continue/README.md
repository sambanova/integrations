# Overview

This is a demonstration of how to use Sambanova's models as coding assistants leveraging the [Continue](https://www.continue.dev/) extension for VSCode and JetBrains.  The Kit includes:

- A configurable SambaNova Cloud - Continue connector. The connector generates answers from a SambaNova cloud hosted models.

- A configurable SambaStudio - Continue connector. The connector generates answers from deployed LLMs in your SambaStudio Environment.

- An installation, setup, and usage guide.

# Before you begin

For this starter kit, you will need access to an SambaNova Cloud account or a SambaStudio Environment.
> You can use a LLM of your choice, either from SambaNova Cloud or from SambaStudio, but is highly recommended to use Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct

## Set up the account for using the LLM 

The next step sets you up to use one of the models available from SambaNova. It depends on whether you're a SambaNova customer who uses SambaStudio or you want to use the publicly available SambaNova Cloud.

### Setup for Sambanova Cloud users 

1. Create a SambaNova Cloud account at [SambaNova Cloud](https://cloud.sambanova.ai).

2. Get your [SambaNova Cloud API key](https://cloud.sambanova.ai/apis) 

### Setup for SambaStudio users

To perform this setup, you must be a SambaNova customer with a SambaStudio account.

1. Log in to SambaStudio and select the LLM to use (e,g. Bundle with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct) and deploy an endpoint for inference. See the [SambaStudio endpoint documentation](https://docs.sambanova.ai/sambastudio/latest/endpoints.html).

2. Get your endpoint API authorization key. as shown [here](https://docs.sambanova.ai/sambastudio/latest/endpoints.html#_endpoint_api_keys).

## Get Continue Extension/plugin

you will need to install the [Continue](https://www.continue.dev/) [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) or [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue) Extension. *this can be done directly from the extensions/plugins section of you IDE searching ***Continue****

# Setting up

## Setup Continue

After installing Continue you will need to do the basic setup

- First you will be prompted to select a provider Select SambaNova Cloud, and enter your SambaNovaCLoud api key, then click **Connect** and close the ***Continue** window

## Add SambaNovaCloud default models

You should set the ***Continue*** config.json file. press ⌘+l this will open a new ***Continue*** session, Click in the gear ⚙ top right button, the the json file will open, replace the contents of this file with the contents of the [config.json](config.json) provided file, and update the `apiKey` model fields with your SambaNovaCloud API Key

This will add to ***Continue*** the following models
   
- `Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct`
- `Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`
- `DeepSeek-R1`
- `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B`
- `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`
- `Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct`
- `Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct`
- `Llama-3.1-Tulu-3-405B`
- `Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct`
- `Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct`
- `Meta-Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`
- `Meta-Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`
- `Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct`
- `QwQ-32B-Preview`

And will add `Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct` as tab autocompletion model.

### Add SambaStudio models

If you want to use models deployed in your SambaStudio environment you should set the ***Continue*** config.json file. press ⌘+l this will open a new ***Continue*** session, Click in the gear ⚙ top right button, the the json file will open, replace the contents of this file with the contents of the [config.json](config.json) provided file, then replace the content of models list for the following model definition:

```json
"models": [
    {
      "provider": "sambanova",
      "title": "<model name> SambaStudio",
      "model": "<model name>",
      "apiBase": "https://<your sambanova environment>/openai/v1/<project_id>/<endpoint_id>/chat/completions",
      "apiKey": "<Your API Key>"
    }
]
```

update the values to match your environment and deployed endpoint.

> You can add multiple models mixing SambaStudio or SambaNovaCloud then you will see all the models in the dropdown model selector bellow the chat input


# Usage

## Ask question to the LLM in your IDE

You can interact with the LLM directly using ⌘+l command this will open a ***Continue*** session in a new extension window then ask anything to the to the model!

## Ask about selected code

You can ask information of a selected snippet of code to the LLM directly selecting your text and then pressing ⌘+l, this will open a ***Continue*** session in a new extension window with the code snippet as context, then ask anything related with your code!

## Edit code

You can ask your LLM to modify your code, add functionalities, documentation etc, over a selected code snippet, for this first select the code snippet you want the model to modify, then press ⌘+i, this will open an input bar in the top of your IDE, then write your desired changes and press enter, this will generate the modified code for you and you can edit it, accept or reject the proposed changes.

## Understand terminal errors

You can ask the model to inspect your terminal error outputs to explain you the error and give you some suggestions, for this after getting an error in your terminal only press ⌘+shit+r, this will open a ***Continue*** session in a new extension window with the error explanation!

## Code autocompletion
check in your IDE bottom bar the ***Continue*** button and click on Enable Autocomplete, you will see a tick mark indication is enabled, then in all files you will see auto completion suggestions you can accept pressing tab.

## Custom Actions 

You can execute your custom actions/prompts selecting a code snippet and then pressing ⌘+l to open a new ***Continue*** session then write `/<yourCommand>` to generate, see how to create your custom commands [here](#add-custom-actions)

> See more about ***Continue*** extension usage [here](https://docs.continue.dev/how-to-use-continue)

# Customizing the connector

The example template can be further customized based on the use case.

## Add custom actions

You can add your custom commands adding them to the [config.json file](config.json)
 
A custom command should have the following structure

```json
{
  "name": "yourCommand",
  "prompt": "{{{ input }}} \n\n custom prompt",
  "description": "Description of your custom action"
}
```
